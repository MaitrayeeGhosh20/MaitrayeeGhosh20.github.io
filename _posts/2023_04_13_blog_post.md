An Ode to Little Spring:  
When the sky is gray, and the wind blows brown. 
When experiments go crazy and 
Negative results show up … 
When the sun is lazy, and snow blankets the old streets – 
Life goes astray, and the Impostor knocks the door…  
I curl up, in your nook, 
with a cup of coffee, 
the smell warming up my soul. 
And here you are, 
bringing a little more color, 
a little more joy and hope 
to the dull gray, my Little Spring!
