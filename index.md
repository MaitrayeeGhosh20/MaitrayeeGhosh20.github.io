Hello! I am Maitrayee Ghosh, currently a PhD candidate at the Department of Chemistry and Laboratory for Laser Energetics,
University of Rochester.

## About me ...

I am a Physical Chemist who specializes in computational modeling of materials. I rigorously use density-functional theory based molecular dynamics simulations to probe materials in extreme conditions. I am looking for post-doctoral position with research interests in materials science, planetary sciences, mineral physics, astrochemistry and astrobiology.


## Outside work ...

I am from India, from the eastern state of West Bengal. My supportive family has been my pillars of my success. 
Beyond research, I love reading books, writing articles, cooking, painting and actively participate in outreach activities.
